# A letter response to West, et al. (2023)

This repository contains the source code for an eLetter response to 
[West, et al. (2023)](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.ade3535).

It contains refactored code to reproduce some of the results of the original paper,
and present a map showing the locations of the donors for the project-856
in Colombia, which is the only project for which there is fully reproducible 
data and code. 

We have also attempted to reproduce synthetic controls for all of the projects
considered in the manuscript and identify the spatial location of their donors.
Interactive maps displaying these donors are shown in this online book:
