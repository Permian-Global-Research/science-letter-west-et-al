## Preface {.unnumbered}
Contained in this web book are interactive maps for each of the projects considered
in West et al. @west_action_2023. We focus here on the project-level analysis, 
undertaken as part of that publication, where the authors constructed synthetic 
controls (SC) from randomly distributed circular donors from across the country of 
each project. In the [supplementary materials](https://dataverse.nl/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.34894/IQC9LM) for the paper, only the code to 
reproduce results for the *Colombian Project 856* were provided. 

We have attempted to reproduce the results across all considered projects in an 
attempt to evaluate whether potential issues, identified for project 856, exist 
more generally for other project synthetic controls. Further, it is an opportunity 
for us, as researchers, to gain a greater understanding of how the proposed method
works.

In order to reproduce the results for the remaining sites, we are missing 
*"problematic donors"* excluded from the SC matching step and the *filtering 
threshold* for buffer area deforestation rates. We have automated the filtering 
threshold such that when too few donors are selected or an error results from the SC 
matching, the process is rerun with the threshold increased by 10%.

Therefore, the maps presented here do not precisely match those presented by 
the authors in the Supplementary Materials (*Fig. S4.*). However, this exercise
is still informative regarding the general applicability of the methods and to 
what extent they improve on existing manual/selective evidenced-based methods 
that are currently adopted.
