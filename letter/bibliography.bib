We examined the effects of 26 such project sites in six countries on three continents using synthetic control methods for causal inference. We found that most projects have not significantly reduced deforestation. For projects that did, reductions were substantially lower than claimed. This reflects differences between the project ex ante baselines and ex post counterfactuals according to observed deforestation in control areas. Methodologies used to construct deforestation baselines for carbon offset interventions need urgent revisions to correctly attribute reduced deforestation to the projects, thus maintaining both incentives for forest conservation and the integrity of global carbon accounting.},

	abstract = {A globally consistent methodology using satellite imagery was implemented to quantify gross forest cover loss (GFCL) from 2000 to 2005 and to compare GFCL among biomes, continents, and countries. GFCL is defined as the area of forest cover removed because of any disturbance, including both natural and human-induced causes. GFCL was estimated to be 1,011,000 km2 from 2000 to 2005, representing 3.1\% (0.6\% per year) of the year 2000 estimated total forest area of 32,688,000 km2. The boreal biome experienced the largest area of GFCL, followed by the humid tropical, dry tropical, and temperate biomes. GFCL expressed as the proportion of year 2000 forest cover was highest in the boreal biome and lowest in the humid tropics. Among continents, North America had the largest total area and largest proportion of year 2000 GFCL. At national scales, Brazil experienced the largest area of GFCL over the study period, 165,000 km2, followed by Canada at 160,000 km2. Of the countries with {\textgreater}1,000,000 km2 of forest cover, the United States exhibited the greatest proportional GFCL and the Democratic Republic of Congo the least. Our results illustrate a pervasive global GFCL dynamic. However, GFCL represents only one component of net change, and the processes driving GFCL and rates of recovery from GFCL differ regionally. For example, the majority of estimated GFCL for the boreal biome is due to a naturally induced fire dynamic. To fully characterize global forest change dynamics, remote sensing efforts must extend beyond estimating GFCL to identify proximate causes of forest cover loss and to estimate recovery rates from GFCL.},

	abstract = {Studying land use change in protected areas (PAs) located in tropical forests is a major conservation priority due to high conservation value (e.g., species richness and carbon storage) here, coupled with generally high deforestation rates. Land use change researchers use a variety of land cover products to track deforestation trends, including maps they produce themselves and readily available products, such as the Global Forest Change (GFC) dataset. However, all land cover maps should be critically assessed for limitations and biases to accurately communicate and interpret results. In this study, we assess deforestation in PA complexes located in agricultural frontiers in the Amazon Basin. We studied three specific sites: Amboró and Carrasco National Parks in Bolivia, Jamanxim National Forest in Brazil, and Tambopata National Reserve and Bahuaja-Sonene National Park in Peru. Within and in 20km buffer areas around each complex, we generated land cover maps using composites of Landsat imagery and supervised classification, and compared deforestation trends to data from the GFC dataset. We then performed a dissimilarity analysis to explore the discrepancies between the two remote sensing products. Both the GFC and our supervised classification showed that deforestation rates were higher in the 20km buffer than inside the PAs and that Jamanxim National Forest had the highest deforestation rate of the PAs we studied. However, GFC maps showed consistently higher rates of deforestation than our maps. Through a dissimilarity analysis, we found that many of the inconsistencies between these datasets arise from different treatment of mixed pixels or different parameters in map creation (for example, GFC does not detect reforestation after 2012). We found that our maps underestimated deforestation while GFC overestimated deforestation, and that true deforestation rates likely fall between our two estimates. We encourage users to consider limitations and biases when using or interpreting our maps, which we make publicly available, and GFC’s maps.},

	abstract = {Assessing the performance of efforts to reduce emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD+) requires data on forest cover change. Innovations in remote sensing and forest monitoring provide ever-increasing levels of coverage, spatial and temporal detail, and accuracy. More global products and advanced open-source algorithms are becoming available. Still, these datasets and tools are not always consistent or complementary, and their suitability for local REDD+ performance assessments remains unclear. These assessments should, ideally, be free of any confounding factors, but performance estimates are affected by data uncertainties in unknown ways. Here, we analyse (1) differences in accuracy between datasets of forest cover change; (2) if and how combinations of datasets can increase accuracy; and we demonstrate (3) the effect of (not) doing accuracy assessments for REDD+ performance measurements. Our study covers five local REDD+ initiatives in four countries across the tropics. We compared accuracies of a readily available global forest cover change dataset and a locally modifiable open-source break detection algorithm. We applied human interpretation validation tools using Landsat Time Series data and high-resolution optical imagery. Next, we assessed whether and how combining different datasets can increase accuracies using several combination strategies. Finally, we demonstrated the consequences of using the input datasets for REDD+ performance assessments with and without considering their accuracies and uncertainties. Estimating the amount of deforestation using validation samples could substantially reduce uncertainty in REDD+ performance assessments. We found that the accuracies of the various data sources differ at site level, although on average neither one of the input products consistently excelled in accuracy. Using a combination of both products as stratification for area estimation and validated with a sample of high-resolution data seems promising. In these combined products, the expected trade-offs in accuracies across change classes (before, after, no change) and across accuracy types (user’s and producer’s accuracy) were negligible, so their use is advantageous over single-source datasets. More locally calibrated wall-to-wall products should be developed to make them more useful and applicable for REDD+ purposes. The direction and degree of REDD+ performance remained statistically uncertain, as CIs were overlapping in most cases for the deforestation estimates before and after the start of the REDD+ interventions. Given these uncertainties and inaccuracies and to increase the credibility of REDD+ it is advised to (1) be conservative in REDD+ accounting, and (2) not to rely on results from single currently available global data sources or tools without sample-based validation if results-based payments are intended to be made on this basis.},

	abstract = {Global Forest Change datasets have the potential to assist countries with national forest measuring, reporting and verification (MRV) requirements. This paper assesses the accuracy of the Global Forest Change data against nationally derived forest change data by comparing the forest loss estimates from the global data with the equivalent data from Guyana for the period 2001–2017. To perform a meaningful comparison between these two datasets, the initial year 2000 forest state needs first to be matched to the definition of forest land cover appropriate to a local national setting. In Guyana, the default definition of 30\% tree cover overestimates forest area is by 483,000 ha (18.15\%). However, by using a tree canopy cover (i.e., density of tree canopy coverage metric) threshold of 94\%, a close match between the Guyana-MRV non-forest area and the Global Forest Change dataset is achieved with a difference of only 24,210 ha (0.91\%) between the two maps. A complimentary analysis using a two-stage stratified random sampling design showed the 94\% tree canopy cover threshold gave a close correspondence (R2 = 0.98) with the Guyana-MRV data, while the Global Forest Change default setting of 30\% tree canopy cover threshold gave a poorer fit (R2 = 0.91). Having aligned the definitions of forest for the Global Forest Change and the Guyana-MRV products for the year 2000, we show that over the period 2001–2017 the Global Forest Change data yielded a 99.34\% overall Correspondence with the reference data and a 94.35\% Producer’s Accuracy. The Guyana-MRV data yielded a 99.36\% overall Correspondence with the reference data and a 95.94\% Producer’s Accuracy. A year-by-year analysis of change from 2001–2017 shows that in some years, the Global Forest Change dataset underestimates change, and in other years, such as 2016 and 2017, change is detected that is not forest loss or gain, hence the apparent overestimation. The conclusion is that, when suitably calibrated for percentage tree cover, the Global Forest Change datasets give a good first approximation of forest loss (and, probably, gains). However, in countries with large areas of forest cover and low levels of deforestation, these data should not be relied upon to provide a precise annual loss/gain or rate of change estimate for audit purposes without using independent high-quality reference data.},

	abstract = {NASA’s Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) is collecting spaceborne full waveform lidar data with a primary science goal of producing accurate estimates of forest aboveground biomass density (AGBD). This paper presents the development of the models used to create GEDI’s footprint-level ({\textasciitilde}25 m) AGBD (GEDI04\_A) product, including a description of the datasets used and the procedure for final model selection. The data used to fit our models are from a compilation of globally distributed spatially and temporally coincident field and airborne lidar datasets, whereby we simulated GEDI-like waveforms from airborne lidar to build a calibration database. We used this database to expand the geographic extent of past waveform lidar studies, and divided the globe into four broad strata by Plant Functional Type (PFT) and six geographic regions. GEDI’s waveform-to-biomass models take the form of parametric Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) models with simulated Relative Height (RH) metrics as predictor variables. From an exhaustive set of candidate models, we selected the best input predictor variables, and data transformations for each geographic stratum in the GEDI domain to produce a set of comprehensive predictive footprint-level models. We found that model selection frequently favored combinations of RH metrics at the 98th, 90th, 50th, and 10th height above ground-level percentiles (RH98, RH90, RH50, and RH10, respectively), but that inclusion of lower RH metrics (e.g. RH10) did not markedly improve model performance. Second, forced inclusion of RH98 in all models was important and did not degrade model performance, and the best performing models were parsimonious, typically having only 1-3 predictors. Third, stratification by geographic domain (PFT, geographic region) improved model performance in comparison to global models without stratification. Fourth, for the vast majority of strata, the best performing models were fit using square root transformation of field AGBD and/or height metrics. There was considerable variability in model performance across geographic strata, and areas with sparse training data and/or high AGBD values had the poorest performance. These models are used to produce global predictions of AGBD, but will be improved in the future as more and better training data become available.},

We assessed relationships between past deforestation and existing networks of highways, navigable rivers, and all other roads, including more than 190,000 km of unofﬁcial roads. We found that deforestation was much higher near roads and rivers than elsewhere in the Amazon; nearly 95\% of all deforestation occurred within 5.5 km of roads or 1 km of rivers. Protected areas near roads and rivers had much lower deforestation (10.9\%) than did unprotected areas near roads and rivers (43.6\%). If one assumes that existing protected areas halt deforestation, then we estimate that 39,462 km2 of expected forest clearing would have been avoided. However, if one assumes that protected areas merely displace deforestation to other locations, then we estimate that 34,501 km2 of expected clearing would have been displaced elsewhere. We conclude that proximity to transportation networks, particularly the rapidly growing unofﬁcial road network, is a major proximate driver of deforestation in Amazonia and that protected areas are having a strong mitigating effect on that risk.},

This article examines the impact of Colombia’s lockdown on forest fires, motivated by satellite data showing a particularly large upsurge of fires at around the time of lockdown implementation. We find that Colombia’s lockdown is associated with an increase in forest fires compared to three different counterfactuals, constructed to simulate the expected number of fires in the absence of the lockdown. To varying degrees across Colombia’s regions, the presence of armed groups is correlated with this fire upsurge. Mechanisms through which the lockdown might influence fire rates are discussed, including the mobilisation of armed groups and the reduction in the monitoring capacity of state and conservation organisations during the covid-19 outbreak. Given the fast-developing situation in Colombia, we conclude with some ideas for further research.},
